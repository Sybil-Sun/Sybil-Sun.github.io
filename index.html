    <h2>Job Market Paper</h2>
    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Expected Fertility, Labor Market Contracts, and the Gender Wage Gap (2025)</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper examines how employers' expectations about women's future fertility enlarge the gender wage gap in markets with labor contracts—standard settings in many occupations that require long-horizon, complex tasks. In such environments, salaries are preset based on expected match productivity, not solely on contemporaneous output; if employers anticipate workers' future fertility interruptions, they post lower wages today. Exploiting China's relaxation of the One-Child Policy as a quasi-experiment, a difference-in-differences design reveals that women's wages declined by 15.3% immediately after the reform, despite no short-term increase in actual births. To interpret these facts, I build a search and matching model with a joint household decision problem, in which fertility is given but uncontractable fertility-driven efforts are chosen. I further incorporate learning-by-doing human capital accumulation that depends on effort, which amplifies and propagates the impact of effort changes over time. Quantitatively, gender differences in expected productivity—rooted in the unbalanced division of household labor—account for nearly all of the pre-reform wage gap and about 80% of the post-reform widening. The policy implication is stark: women-protective rules that merely keep women employed through legislative contract provisions may not reduce the gap; by strengthening employers' present-value pricing, they can be offset by ex-ante wage markdowns applied to all women.</p>

        <strong>Technology, Growth and Skill Obsolescence</strong> (with Rong Hai, Joseph Kaboski), 2025.
        <p class="abstract"><em>Abstract:</em> Work experience is an important source of human capital and growth, especially in advanced economies. However, poor countries exhibit lower measured returns to experience. The reasons for these patterns could have important implications for growth and development. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism that contributes to the limited wage growth over the life cycle in developing countries with very different implications for growth. Specifically, higher growth rates could lower the relative wage for senior workers because rapid technological updates make earlier vintages of human capital obsolete. This technology-induced skill obsolescence leads to lower measured returns to experience, resulting in lower relative wages for older cohorts and exacerbating inter-generational inequality.</p>

        <strong>How Significant is the Impact of a Negative Grade Shock?</strong> (with Virna Vidal Menezes, Zhongheng Qiao), 2025.
        <p class="abstract"><em>Abstract:</em> A student’s major choice is pivotal for academic progress and later labor-market outcomes. This paper examines an overlooked driver of major selection: unexpected grade shocks in early years in college. Using administrative records from Purdue University, we combine course evaluation data that elicit students’ expected letter grades just before final exams with realized grades to construct grade shocks (actual minus expected). We find that unexpected negative shocks significantly increase the likelihood that students switch out of their current major in the subsequent term. The response is stronger for women: a one standard-deviation negative shock raises the probability that a female student leaves her major by about 2.5 percentage points relative to female peers without such a shock. These results highlight the role of early performance signals in major sorting and reveal meaningful gender heterogeneity in responsiveness to adverse academic feedback.</p>

        <strong>Flexible Imputation of Incomplete Network Data</strong> (with Weisheng Zhang), 2025.
        <p class="abstract"><em>Abstract:</em> Incomplete network data are common in empirical research due to the high cost of data collection. We propose a new method to impute the network under the assumption of dyadic link formation. The method avoids parametric assumptions, does not rely on low-rank conditions, and flexibly incorporates observed node covariates and heterogeneity. The method separately estimates the part of the network explained by covariates and the residual structure: the former via projection onto the conditional expectation and the latter via localized principal component analysis. We establish entrywise convergence rates for the imputed adjacency matrix that achieve Stone's minimax optimal rate for nonparametric regression. Simulation studies demonstrate strong performance relative to existing methods, and we illustrate how the imputed network can be used in empirical applications.</p>
